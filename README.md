# Deploy a React App with the AWS CDK

This is the companion project to my post [Deploy a React App with the AWS CDK](https://rhythmandbinary.com/post/2023-02-21-Deploy-a-React-App-with-the-AWS-CDK).

The project uses the AWS CDK to do a bucket deployment. The actual usage of the CDK is in the `infra` folder. The project lays out a basic static deployment with an S3 bucket and a Cloudfront CDN. I recommend checking out the [AWS Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/best-practices.html) to learn more about using the CDK.
